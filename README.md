# LAO Groceries — Marketing Website

A static, SEO/LLM-friendly marketing site for **LAO**, a discounted grocery delivery app (store pickup coming soon) for Tier 3 Indian cities (launching in Mandideep, Madhya Pradesh). Built from the Figma prototypes for the mobile and web experiences, with the web nav/layout patterns back-ported into the mobile view so small screens aren't missing navigation or the cities/map content.

## Stack

- **[Astro](https://astro.build)** — ships zero JS by default, outputs plain static HTML/CSS. Ideal for a marketing site that needs to be fast and easy for search engines and LLM crawlers to parse.
- **[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com)** — utility-first styling via `@tailwindcss/vite`, no separate config file needed (theme tokens live in `src/styles/global.css`).
- **`src/pages/sitemap.xml.ts`** — writes `/sitemap.xml` on build, listing every page in `src/pages/`. It replaced `@astrojs/sitemap`, which can only name its file `sitemap-index.xml`, so `/sitemap.xml` (the URL people and SEO tools try first) was a 404.
- No component/UI kit dependency — a small hand-rolled `Icon.astro` (inline SVGs) keeps the bundle dependency-free.

Everything renders to static HTML; the only client-side JavaScript is the ~30-line mobile menu toggle in `Header.astro`. There's no build-time data fetching, database, or backend.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:4321/
npm run build    # outputs to dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build locally
```

## Where it lives: `www.laogroceries.in`

This site is the root of `www.laogroceries.in` (`laogroceries.in` redirects to
it). The shop, `app_customer_fe`, is a separate Render service on
`app.laogroceries.in`; the "Order" buttons here link to `site.appUrl`. The two
repos share no code and no path.

- It was once served under `/about/`. The old URLs still work: `redirects` in
  `astro.config.mjs` writes a small redirect page at `/about/`,
  `/about/privacy/`, `/about/terms/` and `/about/refunds/`, because shipped
  Android builds and the Play listing link to the policy pages by those paths.
- `robots.txt` and `llms.txt` are in `public/`, so they are served at the
  domain root where crawlers look for them.
- Reference files from `public/` through `withBase()` from `src/data/site.ts`
  (it is a no-op at the root, but keeps a base path a one-line change).

Requires Node 22+.

## Content

All copy, nav links, service categories, FAQ, and the nearby-towns list (`nearbyTowns`) live in **`src/data/site.ts`**. Update the site name, Play Store URL, free-delivery threshold, support/business emails, phones, Grievance Officer (shown on the policy pages) or social links there as well. While `playStoreUrl` is empty, every "Download App" button reads "Order Online" and links to the web app, and the Google Play badge reads "Coming soon on" with no link (`primaryCta`, `PlayBadge.astro`).

## Design notes

- Faithfully follows both Figma prototypes (mobile: `node-id=127-102`, web: `node-id=116-150`). The mobile prototype in Figma had no header navigation; this build adds the same nav (as a slide-down drawer) to mobile so the experience is consistent across breakpoints, per the brief.
- The Madhya Pradesh "This Is Where LAO Begins" map is a real illustrated map graphic (`public/images/mp-map.webp`), background-removed from a supplied asset — not a hand-drawn placeholder.
- The hero product collage and 5 of the 6 "Our Services" category photos (Fresh Product, Dairy, Household Goods, Beauty, Baby Care) are real photography, optimised to WebP and stored in `public/images/`. **Snacks** still has no source photo, so it falls back to the original icon tile — drop a `service-snacks.webp` into `public/images/` and set `image: "/images/service-snacks.webp"` on that entry in `src/data/site.ts` once one's available (`Services.astro` already prefers `service.image` over the icon when present).
- The phone "Sign In" screen (phone number + SMS code, matching the real app) in the "Built for Your City" section and the footer's photographic aisle backdrop are still coded HTML/CSS or a colour treatment rather than real screenshots/photography — swap them in via `public/` + `<img>`/`background-image` whenever those assets are available.
- The "discounted home delivery" positioning is called out in the hero, the "Best Prices" point and the FAQ. Store pickup is not open yet, so it appears only as "coming soon" (trust badge, hero copy, FAQ, footer Pickup Points) — see `whyLaoPoints`, `trustBadges`, `faqs`, and `storeLocations` in `src/data/site.ts`.
- **`site.freeDeliveryAbove`** (₹149) and **`site.deliveryFee`** (₹10) are the delivery-fee promise on the site (hero, CTA, FAQ, Terms §6, meta description): free on the first order and from ₹149, ₹10 below. They must match the rule checkout charges (`priceBasket` in `app_admin`'s `customer-orders`); change both together.
- The footer's contact row splits **Customer Support** (`support@`, phones, hours — the `#contact` anchor), **Business Enquiries** (`contact@`) and **Pickup Points**. The **Grievance Officer** (`site.legal.grievanceOfficer`), which the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 require an Indian e-commerce site to name, is in the contact section of each policy page.
- The footer's **Help** column has no "Track Your Order" link on purpose: the web app has no orders URL to deep-link to.
- The footer uses the same `logo.png` as the header, on a white badge (`<Logo variant="light">`), because the green artwork does not show on the dark footer.
- **`site.legal`** in `src/data/site.ts` (rendered in the footer — "A venture of …" under the logo, and the CIN and registered office in the bottom bar — and as `legalName` in the JSON-LD) names the operating company, ETI TECH PRIVATE LIMITED, with its CIN and registered office. D&B (D-U-N-S) and the Apple/Google developer programs check the site against the company's MCA record, so keep these identical to it. `registeredOffice` and `address` (used in the JSON-LD) are the full registered office address.
- **`storeLocations`** in `src/data/site.ts` (rendered in the footer) is a single "Pickup points in Mandideep — Coming soon" entry. Replace it with real pickup-store addresses as stores open.

## SEO / LLM-friendliness

- Semantic HTML5 (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`), a single `<h1>`, and a logical heading hierarchy throughout.
- `Seo.astro` centralises `<title>`, meta description, canonical URL, Open Graph/Twitter tags, and JSON-LD (`GroceryStore` + `FAQPage` schema).
- `public/robots.txt` (allowing GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Google-Extended) and `public/llms.txt` are served from the domain root; `robots.txt` lists the sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`, the one to submit in Search Console).
- FAQ content is real markup (`<details>/<summary>`, no JS) so it's crawlable and matches the FAQPage structured data.
- The domain is hardcoded to `https://www.laogroceries.in` in `astro.config.mjs` and `src/data/site.ts`, so canonical URLs, the sitemap and OG tags always point at `https://www.laogroceries.in/` — never at the `onrender.com` address, which would otherwise be indexed as a duplicate.

## Deploying to Render

This repo is set up as a Render **Static Site**:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Root Directory | _(leave blank — repo root)_ |
| Build Command | `npm install && npm run build` |
| Publish Directory | `dist` |
| Environment variable | `NODE_VERSION=22` (the app requires Node 22+) |

Custom domains on this service: `www.laogroceries.in` and `laogroceries.in` (Render redirects the apex to `www`). DNS: `CNAME www` to `laogrocery-website.onrender.com`; the apex uses the record Render shows when you add it. Move the domains in Render *before* changing the DNS record, otherwise `www` has no certificate and the site is down until Render issues one.

## Before going live

- [ ] Add a real Snacks category photo (see Design notes above) and drop in a phone-login screenshot / footer aisle photo / accurate MP map if those become available. The current `mp-map.webp` still pins Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Ujjain and Dewas; replace it with one pinning Mandideep, Sehore and Vidisha.
- [ ] Set `playStoreUrl` in `src/data/site.ts` once the app is listed on Google Play, and update `site.social` once the Instagram/Facebook/LinkedIn accounts exist (the handles there are placeholders).
- [ ] Replace the "coming soon" `storeLocations` entry in `src/data/site.ts` with real pickup-store addresses once they open.
- [ ] Re-run `npm run build` and spot check `dist/` before deploying.
